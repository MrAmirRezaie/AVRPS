# Security Policy

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in AVRPS, please follow these steps to responsibly disclose the issue:

1. Do not publish the vulnerability publicly.
2. Open a private issue on the GitHub repository or email the maintainer (see README for contact link).
3. Provide a clear description, affected versions, and steps to reproduce. If possible, include a minimal reproducible example.
4. Allow the maintainers reasonable time to investigate and remediate.

## Maintenance and disclosure

- Security fixes will be released in a timely manner; the maintainer will coordinate disclosure and provide patches or guidance.
- If you would like to remain anonymous, indicate so in the report.

## Third-party libraries

AVRPS relies on several third-party dependencies. Keep these up-to-date and monitor security advisories. Use \pip list --outdated\ to find outdated packages.
